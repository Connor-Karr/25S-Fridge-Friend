# Fridge Friend

## Our Project

FridgeFriend is a data-driven mobile application designed to streamline healthy eating by intelligently combining real-time fridge inventory management, personalized nutrition tracking, and dynamic meal suggestions. In today’s fast-paced world, many people struggle to balance health goals with daily responsibilities, often leading to poor eating habits, food waste, and reliance on takeout. FridgeFriend tackles these challenges by creating a holistic solution that eliminates the need for juggling multiple apps for grocery lists, recipe planning, and macro tracking. At its core, FridgeFriend leverages user-inputted and scanned food inventory data to provide tailored recipe recommendations based on what’s actually available in the user’s kitchen. The app continuously calculates intake throughout the day and aligns suggested meals with the user’s dietary goals, preferences, and restrictions, reducing decision fatigue around meal planning

FridgeFriend’s data-centric design enables adaptive, user-specific insights that evolve with changing food patterns. Whether for fitness enthusiasts monitoring macros, students trying to make the most of limited groceries, or families looking to reduce waste, the app offers a smart, intuitive interface that encourages better eating habits. The end result is a more health-conscious and sustainable approach to food management.
